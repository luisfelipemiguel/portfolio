### Objectives
- Solve a problem using lists in Python.

### WORK PROPOSAL
The task is to create a program that simulates the drawing and registration of keys for the popular Euromillions game according to the following parameters:

- Store the drawn Euromillions key (randomly generated with valid values): a list for generated numbers and a list for generated stars.
- Fill in the Euromillions key (with valid values): a list for numbers and a list for stars.
- **NOTE:**
  - Duplicate values cannot be registered in the lists. This validation must be performed by creating a function (do not use Python built-in functions like `choices`).

- Check how many numbers and stars you hit and assign monetary prizes.

### SUBMISSION
Submit the file on Teams by March 10, 2024. The file name should follow the structure: `trabaval-intrprogram-name.py`, where `name` should be replaced with your first and last name.

2. Insert valid values in both lists ......................................................................... **30%**
3. Duplicate number verification ............................................................................. **18%**
4. Check how many numbers and stars you hit .................................................................. **18%**
5. Prize assignment .......................................................................................... **8%**
6. Programming style (correct use of loops, lists, etc.) and use of comments ................................. **10%**
